  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Ground meat:</strong> This meatball recipe uses a blend of ground beef, ground veal, and ground pork. You can switch it up depending on what you have on hand.

      <strong>Seasonings and herbs:</strong> These meatballs are flavored with fresh garlic, fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley, and ground black pepper.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs keep the meatballs from drying out and they act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the ingredients together.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cheese:</strong> You'll need a cup of freshly grated Romano cheese. If you can, avoid the pre-grated stuff for this recipe.
    </li>

      <strong>Italian bread:</strong> Slightly stale Italian bread is preferable. If your bread feels soft, try letting it sit out overnight.

      <strong>Water:</strong> Slowly add water to the mixture before you roll the meatballs. It'll keep the meatballs nice and moist. Some reviewers prefer to use milk.
